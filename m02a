radie = int(input("Vad är radien av din cirkel? ")) #This is an input which asks for the radie and is inculdes int because the answer is a number
svar = str(input("Do you want to calculate the area or the circumferense? For area type a and for circumference type o")) #Here it asks if you want the area or the circumference


omkrets = (radie * 2) * math.pi #in this line we calculate the circumferense of the circle with the help of math.pi
x = round(omkrets, 2) # which then here define it as x so we can print it out later in a string


area = (radie**2) * math.pi  #here we calculate the area and we use ** which means to the power of  and we get help froom import math and we type math.pi for the number pi in our calculations
y = round (area, 2) #Here we we define y which is help full when we wanna use y in a whole sentense 

if(svar == 'a'):# here  if the person answers o or a as the question is asked the answers vari and the get diffrent numbers which is either the area or the circumferense
